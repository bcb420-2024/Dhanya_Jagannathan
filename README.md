# Dhanya_Jagannathan
Hi there 👋!

My name is Dhanya, and I am a 3rd year bioinformatics specialist + CS major! I am currently doing my BCB330 project in Dr. Jared Simpson's lab, where I work on understanding (via simulations) what the ideal sequencing read length and error rate is for high-throughput sequencing reads (Illumina, PacBio, etc) to be correctly mapped to a reference genome! I am also part of the dry-lab subteam at [iGEM Toronto](https://igem-toronto.github.io/), where we aim to tackle world issues using synthetic biology 🧬🧪👩‍🔬! For our [2023 project](https://2023.igem.wiki/toronto/), we utilized synthetic biology principles to engineer an optimized methylotrophic E. coli strain to uptake methanol from landfill gas as a source of energy, and decrease the gas pollution in local communities.
